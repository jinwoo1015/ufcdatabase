Knockout or submission?\n","* Do they like to fight until the end of all rounds or finish as early as possible?\n","*   Do they have some sort of pattern on how they lose? Knockout or submission?\n","* what rounds do they lost the most? at the beginning, at the end, or by decision?\n","\n","### these are some of the examples but much more interpretation are possible and welcomed.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Here are some basic terms from MMA world for those who are not familiar with this sport to help you with the better understanding of this data.\n","* Knockout (KO, TKO(technical knockout)) -  fight result when a strike or combination of strikes renders a fighter unable to continue. \"KO\" for short. When the referee determines that a fighter is not unconscious but is unable to defend himself, the ref declares it a technical knockout (TKO).\n","* Submission - fight result when a fighter cannot escape a choke or joint lock and either taps out or verbally submits.\n","\n","### for more MMA vocabs -
